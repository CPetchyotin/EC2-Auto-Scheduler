EC2 Auto Scheduler 
A simple script to stop your EC2 instances at workhours. 
I made this to solve the classic problem: forgetting to turn off dev servers and waking up to a painful AWS bill.

Techstack
- Terraform
- Python 

For the choice that I made about start the EC2 manually not with schedule because It is better for cutting the cost optimisation.
